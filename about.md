I am a Web Consultant usually wearing many hats: Entrepreneur, Programmer, Free Software and Open Source Advocate, Web Developer, Systems Administrator, to make it short Geek. I was born and raised in Venezuela and had the wonderful opportunity of studying and living in France for three years.

I spend most of my time developing web applications, WordPress is my CMS of choise for which I have developed a couple of plugins widely used worldwide. You are invited to check them out: [Network Latest Posts], [Single Latest Posts Lite] and [Single Latest Posts]. My articles about technology and web development are published on [8Âª Elite] and [UX-U] (soon).
