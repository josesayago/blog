Learning is not an easy endeavor, in order for one to succeed it is necessary to sacrifice something. Time and energy are limited and scarce resources, success cannot be achieved if they are not properly invested to reach one goals.

We live in a digital world, opportunities to procrastinate lurk around every corner. It is certainly difficult to find time to focusing on one task at a time.

You must find passion in learning, otherwise you will not succeed. Intellectual activities are time consuming and demand high doses of concentration.

It is certainly possible, but you must put all of your effort, do you have what it takes?

I recommend you to read **"[The Art of Explanation]"** which contains great insight into the process of teaching and learning:
