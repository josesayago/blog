Learning is not an easy endeavor, in order for one to succeed it is necessary to sacrifice something. Time and energy, are limited and scarce resources; success cannot be achieved if they are not correctly invested on proper goals.

But what can we do if we notice most of the time we are wandering around, wasting time or what is known as procrastination. It is certainly difficult to fight against ourselves for a little bit of time. We need to focus, but focusing is not easy either.

Learning is an act of passion, giving yourself to something bigger than you. Absorbing knowledge from its source is time consuming and always leads you to despair.
