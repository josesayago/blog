Star Wars is one of those movies that makes you feel happy, excited, disappointed, angry and confused at the same time. If you were born in mid 70's - 80's you then maybe watched the sequels first. At the time everything seemed right and after some thinking it actually made kind of sense.

However, if like me you waited until the last one came out and started watching it from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/">Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</a>, then you start seeing wholes in the plot that makes you laugh and wonder how hard is to keep track of things that were said and done 20+ years ago.

It is easy to sit down and criticize the plot holes and even stupid things, moverover when you start watching it from prequels, however we cannot deny, master Lucas created a wonderful universe that still today entertain us, makes us laugh and push our imaginations to its limits.
