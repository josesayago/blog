We are creatures of habits, it is easy for us to get accustomed to a life routine; go to work, come back home, eat, watch some T.V, browse on the Internet, go to sleep.

Repeating the same routine every single day becomes a natural behavior, therefore, we slowly begin losing our ability to quickly react to unexpected situations.

This affects our lives in different ways, we turn into boring beings, lose professional opportunities and living with others becomes a difficult experience.

There are things we can do to fight this state of inertia though, for instance, going out of our zone of comfort is the first step. I have experienced first hand, the benefits of opening to new and sometimes unknown professional experiences.

Meeting new people, other places, getting into new educational experiences, it can prove rewarding and beneficial for both your health and your life overall.

Next time you are faced with difficult choices, pick the ones you are not completely comfortable with. Every time we are faced with new and unknown situations, we tend to hide behind our previous experiences and things we already know our *zone of comfort*.
