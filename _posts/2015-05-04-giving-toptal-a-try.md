Almost a month ago a message from a [Toptal] software engineer and recruiter landed in one of my public email inboxes. After some research and reading several reviews, almost all of them good, I must say I was still not convinced.

I have been on the Internet for more than 15 years, as a "mainly" Front-end developer I have been contacted by lots of people looking for someone (_to exploit_), they want the best professionals for the least of money.

However, after some digging I decided to give it a try. As someone who likes to give prompt answers to customers' requests and get the work done in record time, I must say I am impressed with people working at [Toptal], they seem open enough to get contacted and willing to give you all the information you need before deciding.

I have read their filtering process is difficult enough, only 3% of candidates make it through the whole process. I am already on queue for a spot in the Front-end ranks, it seems there are more than 2700 candidates already being interviewed which makes it quite a challenge.

Why would I like to join [Toptal]? Well it seems they are working with some serious companies looking for the best professionals out there, these companies are not making you waste your time trying to lower your rates, they just want things done the best way possible and that is what I am after.
