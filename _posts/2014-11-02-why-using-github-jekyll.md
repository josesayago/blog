I am passionate about WordPress, actually my blogs are running on it without any issues. However, yesterday I started thinking _"what would happen if&hellip;"_. Then I realized I needed a place to save my writings without risking of losing them in case I can no longer pay for my web server, my data gets corrupted or I die.

I have been using Github for a couple of years now, just love it. They use Jekyll for generating static pages, no database required and a nice uptime history. So I thought, if I like to share, why not just keep my writings on Github and use Jekyll to display them all?

That way I save server resources, if for some reason I die, everything will be here for a while. Github `forks` are a nice way to keep code/content alive, even after their creators are gone, or abandon their projects.

And finally, I just wanted to learn [Jekyll]/[Markdown]/[Textile]/[Liquid] and my personal blog was the best excuse I could find to do so.
