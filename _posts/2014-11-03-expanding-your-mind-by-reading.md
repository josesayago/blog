Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. I read news, guides, tutorials, documentation, books, etc. Reading has [positive effects on your brain]. It is also a great way to improve your vocabulary.

Nowadays we find ourselves so immersed in busy schedules, we hardly find time to invest in reading. It has been demonstrated only a few minutes of reading have great positive impact.

I usually read before going to bed, this helps me reduce stress, feel more creative and have nice dreams. I have also noticed I am able to solve issues during my sleep time.

Let me give you some advice, if you want to expand your mind, become smarter and find solutions to your problems while sleeping; read a book for at least 6 minutes before going to bed. You will not regret it.

Looking for a good read, I recommend you this book: [Words Can Change Your Brain: 12 Conversation Strategies to Build Trust, Resolve Conflict, and Increase Intimacy]
